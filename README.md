# Image to Speech: Extract Text from Images and Convert to Voice

## üìå Project Description

This project extracts text from an image using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and converts the extracted text into speech using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. It leverages the **Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct** model for enhanced vision-language understanding, ensuring accurate text extraction from complex images. This can be useful for visually impaired individuals, language learners, or situations where reading text manually is inconvenient.


## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Uses **Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct** for high-accuracy text extraction.
- Converts extracted text to speech using a text-to-speech engine.
- Supports multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.).
- Outputs audio in a clear and natural voice.

## ‚ö° Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct** (for vision-language understanding)
- **Tesseract OCR** (for text extraction)
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** (for voice conversion)
- **PIL (Pillow)** (for image processing)
